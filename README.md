# Lima Shelter 2.0

## About
Update of the Shelter 2.0 design to simplify the construction and and reduce material usage, using design details in the smaller 8x8 Shelter 2.0 design. 

Allthough several of the parts have been fabricated, a complete structure hasn't been built from thus design yet so there could be problems. Consider yourselves warned.

And just because someone will ask, it was named for the city in Peru and not the bean.
