# Lima Shelter 2.0

## About
Update of the Shelter 2.0 design to simplify the construction and and reduce material usage, using design details in the smaller 8x8 Shelter 2.0 design. 

Although several of the parts have been fabricated, a complete structure hasn't been built from thus design yet so there could be problems. Consider yourselves warned.

And just because someone will ask, it was named for the city in Peru and not the bean.

## Changes and issues

* The Lima Shelter has 2 more sheets of 1/2" material, but 11 less sheets of 3/4". 

* It is somewhat material agnostic, and can be made from material that's close to the designed size

* The half-lap connections in the rib parts have been replaced with bolted splice plates. They are both easier to assemble and much faster to cut

* The longitudinal slotted stringers that connect the ribs have been replaced with purlins that are fastened with screws into small plywood pads. This allows the ribs to be narrower, giving more interior room. Shallow dimples (on their own layer in the files) mark the location of pilot holes for the screws.

* There's now one door instead of two...2 doors ended up being a pain! This also allowed us to create a solid wall version that only requires a few cutting mods, and mounting the trim pieces on the outside of the endwall, instead of on the inside for a door. The Sketchup model should help illustrate that

* This version doesn't have any windows. We haven't come up with a great idea for them and figured we would see what others came up with.

* Most of the bolts are now 1/4" or 6mm instead of 3/8". The only exception are the bolts holding the sleepers together...they are still 3/8".
